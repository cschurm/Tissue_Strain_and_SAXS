<h1>Check image quality</h1> 

<p>The image quality can be checked quickly by the user with few images (2-3) that are recorded before starting the actual experiment.</p>
 
<p>To start click the button 'Check image qualiy' in the main gui or type 'CheckImageQuality;' at the MATLAB command line and press 'ENTER'.<br>
<img src="images/QualityTestSelectRegion.png" width="40%" alt=""><br>
On the first image, the user should select the region of interest by marking upper left and bottom right corners of a rectangle.</p>

<p>The contrast (histogram), correlation (value in [0,1]) and relative entropy (value in [0,1]) within each single image are evaluated:<br>

A green histogram indicates a good quality without further user action, while a red histogram stands for a bad quality that requires further user action.</p>
 
<p>The corresponding log file (imagequality.log) contains the correlations between the images (1 compared to others) and required user actions:<br>

In this example no user action is required.
The noise (variance) between the images is also shown:<br>

<p>Another example requires some user actions:<br>
